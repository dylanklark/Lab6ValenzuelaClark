Just a basic example of inheritance with Java. It has different modes of transportation such as car, boat, and airplane that inherit from air, water, and land superclasses, 
which further inherits from a Transportation superclass (so, 3 levels of inheritance). Then the program's main simulates a customer portal to rent or purchase a ticket for each 
type of transportation. Once customer has selected their transportation method, it prints out the total price, pickup time/location, and amount of passengers.
